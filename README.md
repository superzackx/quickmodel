# Quick Model

Quick Model is a simple program which creates tensorflow image classifcation models from the input given. No changing code every 1 model!

## Usage

1. Clone the repo with ```git clone https://github.com/superzackx/quickmodel.git``` 
2. CD into ```src```, and run ```cli.py``` - This file takes input and saves it into ```gen.json```.
3. This once finished will auto run ```interactive.py``` which is the tensorflow code. Play around with it and customize it as you want.

## New Features

1. I'll be releasing new scripts each month + packaging the scripts into one UNIX executable.
